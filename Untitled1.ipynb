    "A text editor is a type of computer program that edits plain text. It consists of a string with a cursor. In the initial state, the string is empty with the cursor at the beginning of the string. Some modern text editors have a clipboard manager - they save a history of copied text.\n",

    "TYPE <text> - insert <text> after the current position of the cursor, where <text> consists of at most 50 characters including English letters, digits, whitespaces, and symbols .,?!-. The cursor moves to the end of the inserted text.\n",
    "SELECT <start_index> <end_index> - select the substring of the current text [text[start_index] ... text[end_index]] (inclusive indices, 0-based) of length end_index - start_index + 1. It is guaranteed that the indices are valid. The cursor changes its position to the end of the selected area.\n",
    "MOVE_CURSOR <offset> - change the cursor's current position. The <offset> specifies the direction and the value change - if it is negative the cursor moves to the left, and if it's positive the cursor moves to the right. At all times, the cursor is either located at the beginning of the string (before the first character), between two characters, or at the end of the string (after the last character) - the cursor should always be within the text bounds. If the <offset> is larger than the cursor can move, the cursor will move in that direction as much as it can. If there is a selected area, it should be cleared after this operation.\n",
    "COPY - add the text from the selected area to the clipboard. If there is no selected area then do nothing.\n",
    "PASTE <steps_back> - insert the copied text from the clipboard manager. The number <steps_back> specifies which of the stored copied texts to insert. If <steps_back> is 1 then insert the last copied text, if it is 2 then insert the text copied before the last, and so on. It <steps_back> is greater than the clipboard history size then ignore this operation. The cursor moves to the end of the inserted text.\n",
    "PASTE - do the same as if the operation is PASTE 1.\n",
    "Note: If a selected area is not empty and the next operaion is either TYPE or PASTE then the following updating process is expected during the TYPE or PASTE operation:\n",
    "\n",

    "Insert the new text in the place of the deleted text.\n",
